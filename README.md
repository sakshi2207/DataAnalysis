# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Project Requirement

Please perform the following:

a. Write utility functions to calculate the class-wise mean, median, and mode of "Flavanoids" for the entire dataset.

i. The "Class" of alcohol is denoted by the "Alcohol" property.

ii. All these measures should be calculated by you without the help of any 3rd-party libraries.

iii. All these 3 properties should be displayed as a React component in a tabular format as shown below.

b. Write a function that helps you create a new property "Gamma" for each point of the dataset. "Gamma" can be calculated as Gamma = (Ash \* Hue) / Magnesium. Thereafter, calculate the class-wise mean, median, and mode of "Gamma" for the entire dataset.

i. Again, show this in a tabular format.

## Format

| Measure           | Class 1 | Class 2 | Class … | Class … |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Flavanoids Mean   |         |         |         |         |
| Flavanoids Median |         |         |         |         |
| Flavanoids Mode   |         |         |         |         |
